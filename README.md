# Tftools summarize

**The concern is:** I have a lot of changes in terraform and I need a clear way of the concepts that are going to be **deleted|changed|created** only with the resource address. It can be messy to have a super tf plan output when there are **many changes**.

# Installation

## Install latest version

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerscrew/tftools/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

## Install specific release

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerscrew/tftools/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -v "v0.8.0"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't specify `-v` flag, by default will install always latest version.

## Container image

[In this other repo](https://github.com/containerscrew/infratools) I have a container image where you can find this tool `tftools` installed.

https://hub.docker.com/r/containerscrew/infratools/

> Take a look inside [install](./docs/install.md) documentation for other installation methods.

# Usage

Take a look inside docs [usage](./docs/usage.md)

## Built-in subcommand

`tftools usage` is subcommand that prints the contents of [usage.md](docs/usage.md) in pretty terminal markdown render

```bash
tftools usage
```

> Requires internet connectivity, as it fetches the [usage.md](docs/usage.md) file.

# Example

![example](assets/example.png)

*This summarized output can be useful, for example, for:*

* You are migrating a terraform module and there are many changes that may be important in terms of destroying/creating resources (e.g., if you are migrating an EKS module from v17.X to v19.X).
* You use GitOps and deploy terraform from pipeline. The pipeline that makes the `terraform plan` can always show a summary of what is going to change (instead of having a super output of the original terraform plan).

# TO DO

* Improve error handling
* Add tests, although I have no experience
* Code refactor is certainly needed!
* Create new subcommand for an interative terraform state mv target migration (when you need to move a lot of resources)
* Other subcommand when you need to apply only certain targets (terraform apply -target=x -target=x ...)

# Contribution

Pull requests are welcome! Any code refactoring, improvement, implementation.
